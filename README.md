# MyReads Project

This API looks at a database of books and allows you to categorize these books in three categories; "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read". There is a search function that allows you to search for books by titles or name and also allows you to pick the mentioned categories above you want the books to be in.

# How to use the API

This will take you to a search box, type in a name or title and a list of books will appear. Use the drop down menu next to the books that appear to categorize them. Hit the back button to go back to the main page to see the books in their respective categories.
